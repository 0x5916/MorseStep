# Learning architecture and acceptance

This document describes the current frontend. The [UI/UX backlog](ui-ux-audit.md) distinguishes remaining requirements from implemented behavior. Contributor rules live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); types and algorithms are authoritative in source rather than duplicated here.

## Routes and coexistence

- [Learn](../src/routes/morse/learn/+page.svelte) loads device history, recommends a lesson, and derives the unlocked path. It reduces characters incrementally and stops at the first unstable lesson.
- [CoursePath](../src/lib/components/learning/CoursePath.svelte) shows the previous/current/two upcoming lessons, with earlier/later rows in native disclosures. The current row stays outside disclosures. The [curriculum](../src/lib/training/sequence.ts) contains 39 lessons introducing 40 characters.
- [Guided session](../src/routes/morse/learn/session/+page.svelte) creates browser resources and a [reactive controller](../src/lib/training/v2/session-controller.svelte.ts). The controller coordinates prompt playback, scoring, persistence, and interruption handling using the [pure guided state machine](../src/lib/training/v2/guided-session.ts).
- [Practice](../src/routes/morse/practice/+page.svelte) provides continuous copy and character familiarization. Continuous copy retains the separate [passage state machine](../src/lib/training/session.ts); familiarization may show Morse notation because it is an inspection mode. Free practice does not unlock guided progression.
- [Progress](../src/routes/morse/progress/+page.svelte) summarizes recent guided attempts, character mastery, and confusion patterns. Its review action currently returns to Learn rather than starting a targeted session.

## Domain, audio, and persistence

[Prompt types](../src/lib/training/v2/types.ts), [lesson building](../src/lib/training/v2/lesson-builder.ts), [attempt scoring](../src/lib/training/v2/attempt.ts), [mastery](../src/lib/training/v2/mastery.ts), and [progression](../src/lib/training/v2/progression.ts) are pure TypeScript. The controller is the Svelte orchestration exception; presentation components emit intent rather than owning domain decisions.

`reduceCharacterMasteries` indexes a history once for multi-character analysis and shares an evaluation time. Progress and progression use it. Learn deliberately uses the single-character reducer to preserve its early exit; eagerly computing every character can increase work for that route.

[Timing](../src/lib/training/timing.ts) produces plans in seconds; the [audio engine](../src/lib/audio/engine.ts) schedules them and creates Web Audio resources on playback. Attempt latency is stored in integer milliseconds. Audio completion and replay counts feed assessed recognition; inspection/repair must not create duplicate scored attempts.

[IndexedDB](../src/lib/data/training-db.ts) and the [attempt](../src/lib/data/attempt-repository.ts)/[session](../src/lib/data/session-repository.ts) repositories store guided history. [Legacy migration](../src/lib/data/legacy-migration.ts) imports compatible device data. The [legacy progress queue](../src/lib/progressSync.ts) and [IndexedDB outbox](../src/lib/data/outbox-repository.ts) coexist; an outbox repository or [SyncStatus component](../src/lib/components/learning/SyncStatus.svelte) does not establish a working guided server-sync integration.

## UI acceptance requirements

These are requirements for changes, not a claim that every existing flow passes them:

- Preserve the [shared design tokens](../src/app.css), five-locale messages, semantic feedback, theme support, and reduced motion. The layout owns page padding and mobile navigation clearance.
- During assessed recall, reveal no Morse notation or visual decoding cues. Inspection and post-answer repair must remain clearly distinct from scoring.
- Provide one clear primary action, stable answer positions, 44px minimum/48px preferred targets, 8px target spacing, visible focus, and text/icons with success/error feedback.
- Space plays/replays and Enter submits/continues only in the appropriate phase. Escape pauses or opens exit confirmation without immediately discarding the session. Guard composition and focused controls' native keyboard behavior; displayed shortcuts must work.
- Expose session progress with accessible current/maximum values and announce prompt feedback through a live region.
- Exit dialogs need initial focus, contained Tab navigation, Escape/cancel behavior, and focus restoration. Background audio/hotkeys must not bypass a modal.
- Distinguish loading, empty history, initialization failure, audio failure, and unsaved progress. Only offer resume, replay, targeted review, or sync when the associated action is implemented.
- Verify newcomer/returning/review/complete states and full session intent/recovery paths in the browser. Inspect 320px, 390px, and desktop widths, both themes, translated wrapping, disclosure navigation, and overflow. Source review and a static build do not prove these interactions.
