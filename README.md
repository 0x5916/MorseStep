# MorseStep / OpenCW

MorseStep is a sound-first Morse code trainer with guided Koch lessons, free practice, local progress, optional account sync, and a community forum. The repository and deployed service names still use OpenCW.

## Start developing

The frontend requires Node 26; the backend requires the Go version declared in [go.mod](backend/go.mod) and PostgreSQL. Run each subsystem from its own directory:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
cp example.env .env
npm run dev
```

Set `PUBLIC_API_BASE` in the frontend environment to the backend's `/v1` URL. Guided training stores events locally in IndexedDB; account and forum features need the API. Follow the [backend setup](backend/README.md) to start it.

For the full stack, configure the root `example.env` as `.env`, then follow the deployment guide. `make` lists operational commands; `make check` validates configuration. Do not substitute the backend development Compose file for the root deployment stack.

## Architecture and license

`frontend/` uses SvelteKit 5, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Paraglide, and the static adapter. `backend/` uses Go, Gin, and GORM. `db/` supplies PostgreSQL tuning; `scripts/` supplies operational automation. The root `docker-compose.yaml` connects these services, pgAdmin, and Cloudflare Tunnel.

The project uses the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). Bundled agent skills under `.agents/skills/` and generated/dependency documentation are separate from the project guides above.
