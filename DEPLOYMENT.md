# MorseStep production deployment

Deploy the root [Compose stack](docker-compose.yaml) on a Linux host. Use this procedure for installation and recovery, [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for command flags, [example.env](example.env) for configuration defaults, and [db/README.md](db/README.md) for database tuning. Image versions live in Compose.

For a newly created Proxmox LXC, begin with [Fresh LXC setup](#fresh-lxc-setup), then follow [Clone and configure](#clone-and-configure) and [Build and verify](#build-and-verify). A host with Docker already installed can start at cloning.

## Requirements

Use Docker with Compose v2, Bash 4 or newer, Git, Make, gzip, and curl or wget; OpenSSL generates secrets. The scripts require GNU host utilities, so run them on the deployment host. Enable Docker at boot and reserve space for database data, images, and retained backups.

The shipped bindings expose the database at `${DB_PORT:-5432}`, backend at `8080`, and frontend at `3000` on every interface. pgAdmin binds only to `127.0.0.1:${PGADMIN_PORT:-5050}`. Restrict database and application ports with your firewall or loopback bindings when a tunnel or local proxy supplies public access. Retain the loopback mappings used by health probes.

## Fresh LXC setup

Start with the container you already created from a **Debian LXC image/template** in Proxmox. This walkthrough covers an **unprivileged Debian 12 (Bookworm) or Debian 13 (Trixie) LXC**, the releases supported by [Docker's Debian installer](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#os-requirements). The repository setup below reads the release codename from your image automatically.

All shell commands after the Proxmox step run as **root inside the LXC**, using its Console or `pct enter`. Docker builds supply the application's Node and Go runtimes; you do not need to install them in the LXC.

### 1. Prepare the container on Proxmox

For a small initial deployment, an example allocation is **4 CPU cores, 8 GiB RAM, and a 32 GiB root disk**. This is a starting allocation, not a capacity guarantee: image builds need temporary memory and disk space, and data/backups need room to grow. Give the container a stable LAN address, gateway, and working DNS.

With the container stopped, open **Options → Features** in Proxmox and enable **Nesting** and **keyctl**. Enable **Start at boot** in Options. These features allow nested containers and the keyctl system call used by Docker in an unprivileged LXC; see the [Proxmox feature definitions](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-container/blob/master/src/PVE/LXC/Config.pm).

Alternatively, run the following **on the Proxmox host**. Replace `123` with your newly created, stopped container's ID. The `--features` argument sets the feature list; retain any other enabled feature flags if the container already has them.

```bash
CT_ID=123
pct config "$CT_ID"
pct set "$CT_ID" --features nesting=1,keyctl=1 --onboot 1
pct start "$CT_ID"
pct enter "$CT_ID"
```

You are now inside the LXC. Nested Docker compatibility depends on the Proxmox host's kernel and container configuration. The Docker smoke test below is the checkpoint before installing MorseStep. Proxmox recommends a QEMU VM when stronger isolation or live migration is required; see its [container guide](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-docs/blob/master/pct.adoc).

### 2. Install the host tools inside the LXC

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl git make openssl nano \
  bash coreutils findutils gzip iproute2
ip -brief address
getent hosts download.docker.com
```

In `/etc/os-release`, confirm `ID=debian` and either `VERSION_ID="12"` / `VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm` or `VERSION_ID="13"` / `VERSION_CODENAME=trixie`. Note the LXC's LAN IP. If your template uses another release, check Docker's supported releases before continuing; do not point an older Debian installation at the Trixie repository. If package downloads or name resolution fail, fix the container's network/DNS settings in Proxmox.

### 3. Install Docker Engine and Compose

Set up the official Docker APT repository for this fresh Debian installation, following [Docker's Debian guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-apt-repository):

```bash
install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg \
  -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF
Types: deb
URIs: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
Components: stable
Architectures: $(dpkg --print-architecture)
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
EOF

apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \
  docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
systemctl enable --now docker
systemctl is-active docker
docker --version
docker compose version
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Continue when the service reports `active`, Compose prints its version, and the test container prints its success message. If Docker fails, inspect `systemctl status docker` and `journalctl -u docker --no-pager -n 100`; check the LXC features and host configuration before building the application.

### 4. Prepare persistent database storage

```bash
install -d -m 0700 /data/postgres
findmnt -T /data/postgres
df -h / /data/postgres
```

On a fresh container, `/data/postgres` is a directory on its persistent root disk. If using a separate disk or Proxmox mount point, attach it before this step and confirm `findmnt` reports the intended filesystem. Set `POSTGRES_DATA_PATH` to the path visible **inside the LXC**. External bind mounts can need ownership mapping for an unprivileged container; resolve write-permission errors before deployment.

Proxmox backups exclude host bind-mount contents; enable the backup option for additional managed storage mount points and keep the SQL backups described below. See [Proxmox mount-point backup behavior](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-docs/blob/master/pct.adoc#backup-of-container-mount-points).

## Clone and configure

Inside the LXC, clone the complete repository into `/opt/opencw`; Compose bind-mounts [db/tune.sh](db/tune.sh), so the Compose file alone is insufficient. Run all subsequent commands from the checkout root. If you already have a checkout and `.env`, use those rather than copying over your configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x5916/OpenCW.git /opt/opencw
cd /opt/opencw
cp example.env .env
chmod 600 .env
openssl rand -base64 32
nano .env
```

Paste the generated value into `JWT_SECRET` and fill the required values below. In Nano, save with **Ctrl+O**, confirm with **Enter**, then exit with **Ctrl+X**. Keep `.env` out of Git and do not source it as shell code; values such as the sender address contain spaces.

| Configuration | Required values and meaning                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Database      | `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`; select `POSTGRES_DATA_PATH` on persistent storage. An unset path falls back to `./data/postgres`. |
| Access tokens | `JWT_SECRET`: base64 bytes; `make check` requires at least 32 decoded bytes.                                                                           |
| Email         | `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`; both are required by backend startup validation.                                                                |
| Browser API   | `PUBLIC_API_BASE`: browser-reachable V1 URL, for example `https://api.example.com/v1`. It is embedded when the frontend is built.                      |
| CORS          | `CORS_ORIGINS`: comma-separated frontend origins. This is backend runtime configuration.                                                               |
| pgAdmin       | `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`, `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`: separate from database credentials; used to initialize its account.                               |

Set explicit database resource limits on a shared or nested host; see [PostgreSQL resource tuning](#postgresql-resource-tuning). Review optional ports, HTTP timeouts, connection pool settings, and tunnel values in [example.env](example.env), then run `make check`.

For an initial **LAN installation**, replace the following values in `.env`. This example assumes the LXC is `192.168.1.50` with the 4-core/8-GiB allocation above; substitute its actual IP. These are settings to edit, not commands to run:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_DATA_PATH=/data/postgres
POSTGRES_MEMORY_LIMIT=2g
POSTGRES_CPU_LIMIT=2
POSTGRES_SHM_SIZE=256mb
PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://192.168.1.50:8080/v1
CORS_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:3000
```

The database budget leaves room for the backend, pgAdmin, and builds; adjust it for your allocation. The entrypoint automatically calculates PostgreSQL settings such as `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, and worker counts from this budget. You do not need to paste PGTune's calculated settings into `.env`; see [the tuner formulas and PGTune comparison](db/README.md).

`POSTGRES_SHM_SIZE=256mb` is a manual Docker `/dev/shm` capacity in this example, separate from the calculated `shared_buffers`. It overrides the `2gb` default in [example.env](example.env) to keep that capacity below the example's `2g` database memory budget. The tuner checks the available capacity and warns when it may be insufficient; it does not resize it. Adjust this capacity for your parallel-query workload.

Fill `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`, `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` as well. Use separate database and pgAdmin passwords, your Resend API key, and a sender configured in Resend.

`PUBLIC_API_BASE` must be reachable from the computer opening the website. Browser `localhost` means that computer, not the LXC; `backend` is only a Docker-network hostname. Replace the sample's public OpenCW API URL before building your own installation. For HTTPS/public access, use the hostnames described in [Public access](#public-access) instead of the LAN URLs.

```bash
make check
```

Proceed when validation exits successfully. It checks configuration values; Docker container startup and browser connectivity are verified next.

## Build and verify

```bash
make deploy
make status
make backup
```

Deployment can bootstrap `.env` and generate a missing JWT secret, but required credentials still need values. It builds the images, waits for database/backend/frontend/pgAdmin container health, and probes backend and frontend HTTP endpoints. A failed pgAdmin HTTP probe warns. `make status` additionally treats an unhealthy or missing pgAdmin container as a failure; its pgAdmin HTTP probe and tunnel problems are warnings.

The [frontend image](frontend/Dockerfile) runs `npm run verify` before building. The current checkout's IndexedDB tests import `fake-indexeddb`, which is not declared in [frontend/package.json](frontend/package.json); a clean image build can fail at that gate until the dependency manifest and lockfile are corrected. Fix the dependency in the repository before deployment; the LXC's Docker installation does not supply frontend test packages.

Local endpoints are frontend `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, health `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/health`, and pgAdmin `http://127.0.0.1:5050` unless its port changed. `pgadmin-config` exits after rendering configuration; exit 0 is expected.

From **inside the LXC**, check the running services and local endpoints:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/health
curl --fail --head http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Then open `http://192.168.1.50:3000` from another computer on the LAN, using your LXC's actual IP. Confirm the homepage loads, guided training plays audio, and the browser can reach `http://192.168.1.50:8080/v1/health`. Account/email features also need the configured backend and Resend credentials. Port 5050 is loopback-only, so the LAN IP will not expose pgAdmin; use the protected tunnel described below or an SSH forward to the LXC if SSH is configured.

For LAN-only use with no tunnel token, stop the unused tunnel after deployment:

```bash
docker compose stop cloudflared
```

Deploy/update starts it again with the stack, so repeat this step while using LAN-only access. Protect the published ports with the Proxmox/upstream firewall, allowing 3000 and 8080 only from the intended LAN clients and keeping 5432 private. Docker-published ports can bypass an in-container UFW firewall; see [Docker's firewall limitations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#firewall-limitations).

If this first installation fails, use the matching checkpoint:

| Symptom                                              | Check                                                                                                                      |

| Homepage loads but account/API requests fail         | Browser-reachable `PUBLIC_API_BASE`, matching `CORS_ORIGINS`, and access to port 8080; rebuild after changing the API URL. |

## Public access

For Cloudflare Tunnel, configure `CLOUDFLARED_TUNNEL_TOKEN` and route public hostnames to `http://frontend:80`, `http://backend:8080`, and, if needed, `http://pgadmin:80` on the Compose network. Put a restrictive Cloudflare Access policy in front of pgAdmin. `CLOUDFLARED_PROTOCOL` selects the tunnel transport. The service always starts with the stack; an empty token causes restart loops. Stop it explicitly when using a different proxy.

A reverse proxy must terminate TLS and forward the frontend to port 3000 and API to port 8080. Preserve both `/v1` and `/v2` API paths. If adding a public path prefix, include the V1 path in `PUBLIC_API_BASE` and configure proxy rewriting consistently. Rebuild the frontend after changing that value; recreate the backend after changing CORS. Production uses `GIN_MODE=release`, which disables profiling routes; development registers `/debug/pprof/*`, so keep development profiling private.

## Updates and rollback

```bash
make update DRY_RUN=1
make update
```

The update script requires a clean tracked working tree, snapshots locally built images, takes a database backup, fetches and fast-forwards the current branch, rebuilds, and verifies health. Use `scripts/update.sh --ref REVISION` for a branch, tag, or commit. `--auto-rollback` restores prior images on failure; otherwise the script prints rollback commands. The release record is `.deploy-state`. Return from a rollback's detached HEAD to a branch before the next ordinary update.

Backend startup runs GORM `AutoMigrate`. An image rollback does not undo database changes: retain the pre-update dump and restore it when returning to an older schema. `--no-backup` removes that recovery path. See [script flags](scripts/README.md#script-reference).

## pgAdmin administration

pgAdmin's web login uses `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_*`; its database connection uses `POSTGRES_*`. Editing the former after the first initialization does not reset an existing account. Reset through the user interface or the container's `setup.py update-user` command, using the existing login email. Deleting its volume discards saved accounts, servers, and preferences.

The shared [renderer](scripts/render-pgadmin.py) writes `servers.json` and a private per-login `.pgpass` into `pgadmin_data`, escapes all credential fields, and selects that passfile in the connection parameters. It uses host `db`, port 5432, and the configured database role. Startup replaces the configured pgAdmin account's saved server list with this managed OpenCW connection. Bring the stack up after credential changes so the renderer runs; restarting pgAdmin alone does not run it. A password saved separately in pgAdmin must also be updated. The volume holds the database password in plain text; protect it like `.env`. The configured connection uses `sslmode=prefer` and master-password protection is disabled.

## Backups and recovery

```bash
make backup
scripts/backup.sh --dir /mnt/backups
scripts/restore.sh --file backups/opencw_TIMESTAMP.sql.gz
```

Backups are verified gzip plain-SQL dumps, with companion globals dumps for roles and grants. Default retention is 14 dumps; `--keep 0` disables pruning. Restore stages inputs before any database recreation and pins its recovery dump until verification succeeds. Keep copies off the host and protect configuration and pgAdmin state separately. Backup frequency determines how much recent data can be lost; the scripts do not implement continuous recovery.

Restore replaces the live database by default: it requires a database-name confirmation unless `--yes`, takes a pre-restore backup unless `--no-backup`, drops/recreates the database, and loads the data in one transaction. A failed load rolls back that load; the previous database was already dropped. Globals restoration is separate and best-effort. `--append` writes into the existing live schema without the single-transaction guarantee and can leave partial changes. Restart the backend after a successful restore.

Rehearse dumps against a separate scratch database or isolated stack, verify tables and representative records, then remove the scratch database. `--append` against production is not a rehearsal. The restore script accepts its own `.sql` and `.sql.gz` format; pgAdmin custom dumps require `pg_restore` instead.

The root database is a host bind mount at `/var/lib/postgresql`, with `PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`. A live filesystem copy can be inconsistent; use a stopped or application-consistent snapshot as an additional backup and retain the matching PostgreSQL version. `docker compose down` preserves data; `down -v` removes pgAdmin's named volume but not the database bind mount. Before any deliberate data deletion, resolve the configured path and confirm the cluster under its versioned PGDATA directory.

## Monitoring and credential changes

```bash
scripts/status.sh --skip-disk
docker compose logs --tail=100 backend
docker compose logs db
```

Status reports environment validation, containers, endpoints, database readiness, revision, images, backups, and disk usage. It warns when the newest backup is at least seven days old. Schedule backups and status checks using the [cron example](scripts/README.md#scheduled-runs). Compose caps long-running container logs at three 10 MB files. Services use `restart: unless-stopped`; Docker must start at boot, and deliberately stopped services stay stopped.

Rotate the database role password with psql's `\password` prompt, update `.env`, recreate affected services, and update any saved pgAdmin password. Changing `.env` alone does not alter an initialized PostgreSQL role. Changing `JWT_SECRET` invalidates existing access JWTs after backend recreation; opaque refresh tokens remain valid until revoked or expired. Refresh-token invalidation requires separate database handling. Update Resend credentials and recreate the backend; change an existing pgAdmin password through pgAdmin rather than its initialization variables.

## PostgreSQL resource tuning

The database entrypoint chooses memory from an explicit budget, cgroup limits, then host detection; automatic tuning requires at least 512 MiB. CPU sizing takes the minimum of explicit limits, cgroup quotas, effective cpuset, and available CPUs. On LXC or nested hosts the host fallback can overstate available resources, so set `POSTGRES_MEMORY_LIMIT` and `POSTGRES_CPU_LIMIT` to the database's share. These also enforce Docker limits. Keep `POSTGRES_SHM_SIZE` below the memory ceiling and leave headroom for other services.

[db/README.md](db/README.md) owns the detection order, formulas, clamps, override variables, and troubleshooting. Inspect `docker compose logs db` for the selected budget before accepting a deployment. Recreate the database container to apply configuration changes; do not edit cluster files to tune it.
